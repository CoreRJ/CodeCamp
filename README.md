### List of Contents

Welcome! This repository uses interactive Jupyter notebooks to teach you the basics of how to code in Python. Our focus is on simple examples that (we hope) speak to students who are _not_ Computer Scientists by training. Perhaps you dabbled a bit in High School? Perhaps you've never done any programming ever? Whatever, we're here to help!

The list of topics include:
- [Notebook-1: Introduction](./notebook-01-getting-started.ipynb)
- [Notebook-2: Thinking like a computer](./notebook-02-thinking-like-a-computer.ipynb)
- [Notebook-3: The Basics (Variables, Operators and Precedence)](./notebook-03-basic-concepts.ipynb)
- [Notebook-4: Dealing with Errors & Debugging](./notebook-04-errors-and-debugging.ipynb)
- [Notebook-5: Truth & Conditions (Comparisons, Conditions and George Boole)](./notebook-05-truth-and-conditions.ipynb)
- [Notebook-6: Recap 1](./notebook-06-recap.ipynb)
- [Notebook-7: Lists](./notebook-07-lists.ipynb)
- [Notebook-8: Dictionaries](./notebook-08-dictionaries.ipynb)
- [Notebook-9: Loops and Iteration](./notebook-09-iteration.ipynb)
- [Notebook-10: Recap 2](./notebook-10-recap.ipynb)
- [Notebook-11: Functions (Automate All the Things)](./notebook-11-functions.ipynb)
- [Notebook-12: Packages (Bundles of Functions)](./notebook-12-packages.ipynb)
- [Notebook-13: Classes and Objects](./notebook-13-classes.ipynb)
- [Notebook-14: Data Structures (Why Obvious Isn't Always Right)](./notebook-14-data-structures.ipynb)
- [Notebook-15: A Brief Note on Style](./notebook-15-style.ipynb)
- [Notebook-16: Recap 3](./notebook-16-recap.ipynb)
- [Notebook-17: The Terminal](./notebook-17-terminal.ipynb)

### Setting Up

There are several ways to run these notebooks, but the most straightforward way to get started is [using Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kingsgeocomp/code-camp/master).

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will have a basic understanding of:

- The rationale behind the usage of computers and computational methodologies
- The way computers "think" and "work"
- How computers programs are structured and how to execute them
- The fundamental concepts of programming (in Python) such as the concept of `variable`, `iteration`, `data structure`, `list`, `object`, `loop`, `function` etc.,  etc.
- How your newly acquired coding skills can help you be _effectively lazy_.
