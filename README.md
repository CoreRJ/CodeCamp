### List of Contents

Welcome! This the repository for the interactive Jupyter notebooks that will teach you the basics of how to code in Python for 
Geographic Data Analysis.

The (tempatative) list of topics include:
- [Notebook-1: Thinking like a computer](#) 
- [Notebook-2: The Basics](#) 
- [Notebook-3: Dealing with Errors & Debugging](#) 
- [Notebook-4: Truth & Conditions](#) 
- [Notebook-5: Lists and Dictionaries](#) 
- [Notebook-6: Loops & Iteration](#) 
- [Notebook-7: Data Types advanced](#) 
- [Notebook-8: An Intro to Functions](#) 


### Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of:

- The rational behind the usage of computers and computational methodologies within Geography
- The way computers "think" and "work"
- How computers programs are structured and how to execute them
- The fundamental concepts of programming (in Python, but extensible in general terms to any other programming languare) such as the concept of `variable`, `iteration`, `data structure`, `list`, `object`, `loop`, `function` etc etc.. 
- How your newly acquired coding skills can extend traditional GIS methodologies and be applied to solve to geographical problems

But most of all... have fun!!!

### Set-up

The Jupyter Notebook format will allow you to see both the instructions, the code, and its outcome on this website (see below).


However, wouldn't it be much more fun and fruitful if you could actually *run* (i.e. execute) that code on you own machine? 
To do so, you will need to:
-  Download each lesson () there are various ways
