    "Welcome to the seventh Code Camp notebook! In this lesson we'll cover *functions* in Python, a concept that you've already used (more or less knowingly so). This time we'll dig deeper though, explaining more in detail what is a funciton, how to define one, how to use it and when...etc etc...\n",

    "But let's start from the a basic idea: as we saw with the concept of *iteration*, programmers are lazy, and they tend not to repeat boring tasks. \n",

    "\n",
    "This idea to avoid \"wasting time re-inventing the wheel\" and the pragmatic attitude it entails have been pretty much summed up in the acronym **D.R.Y.** (Do not Repeat Yourself): If you are doing something more than once, ask yourself if there's a way to encapsulate what you are doing in a piece of code, an to use just that code instead of re-writing everything. **D.R.Y.** is the opposite of **W.E.T.** (We Enjoy Typing or Write Everything Twice), which on the contrary describes perfectly the other, more verbose, end of the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This attitude has also practical consequences, as it helps you, as a programmer to phisycally (well, digitally!) mantain a claner code-base which is a) much more readable b) easier to mantain c) less error prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be used for this purpose, they express the idea of performing an action on something, and can thus be used to encapsulate bits of your work in an efficient way."

    "As we briefly mentioned in notebook-5, every word followed by a set of parenthesis is function. The word is the function's *name*, and whatever other comma-separated word you put within the paranthesis are the function's *parameters*. Like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "function_name(optional_parameter_1, optional_parameter_2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we *instantiate* a function (i.e. create one)? Like IF, WHILE and other statements, also functions have a specific syntax you have to follow. In particular there are important two important steps: the funciton definition and the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a function definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def myFirstFunc():\n",
    "    print \"Nice to meet you!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what happened there:\n",
    "- To define a function you have to use the reserved *keyword* `def` (which is basically a special word reserved just for the Python interpeter, that you cannot use for other purposes). \n",
    "- After `def` you can specify the function's name. `myFirstFunc` in this case.\n",
    "- After the function's name there's the set of parenthesis and a colon.\n",
    "- Notice that whatever comes after is *indented*. Does this remindes you of something? You guessed correctly, that's like an IF statement. And the reason is the same too! It indicated to the Python interpreter that whatever is indented *belongs* to the function. Is like saying: \"Look man, I'm going to define this `myFirstFunc` function, and whatever is indented afterwards is the *function's body*, the set of instructions that specifies what this function should do\". NOTE: Other languages might accomplish the same result using curly braces for instance ( *{}* ) but Python is more terse and uses indentation. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Function definiton & call\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool, and now that we have defined a function how can we use it? Same as what we did with `len` and `range`. We are going to *call* it, appending the set of parenthesis to its name!\n"
