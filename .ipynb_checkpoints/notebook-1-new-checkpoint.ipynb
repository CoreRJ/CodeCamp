When these rules become sufficiently complex they are called algorithms. And when they get that complex they are not easy to write down as a set of logical outputs, it's often easier to express in a more human-readable form... which is why we have programming languages.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is really important: just because you told the computer to do something 'silly' does _not_ mean that you are stupid. Did you ever try to learn a foreign language? Did you expect to be fluent after a few classes? Assuming that you had a realistic expectation of how far you'd get with French, Chinese, or English, then you probably figured it'd be a few years before you could even hold a conversation with someone else. So why would you expect to sit down at a computer and be able to hold a conversation with it (which is another way of thinking about what a program is) after reading a few pages of text and watching a YouTube video or two?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice makes perfect\n",
    "\n",
    "Your language class (assuming that you took one) probably had two parts: a 'lecture' where you were taught grammar, syntax, and words, and a 'lab' where you practiced. It's the same for programming: the reason you got a 'silly' answer is that we haven't taught you how to ask the right question yet! For a language like Python `2` is not the same as `2.0`... can you now guess what you might need to change in the 'code block' above to get the right answer? Don't worry if you still can't get the right answer, how to 'talk numbers' is the main topic in the _next_ notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, weo want you remember that there are no stupid questions when it comes to programming. We have _all_ been there at one point or another. Many of us still ask for help, just on harder questions. And that's only because we have had a lot more practice in the language of programming. So the _only_ stupid thing you can do in this course is to assume that you can skip the 'lab classes' and don't have to practice what you're learning. There are web sites that will give you answer (in fact, we're going to point you to some of them) but if you don't expend any effort in trying to understand it, or if you just copy the answer off of your friend, that's the same as assuming you'll learn a language just because your friend is taking the same language course! _That_ is silly.\n",

    "\n",
    "What makes a computer potentially _better_ than a calculator (or your brain) is that a computer isn't daunted by having to count lots of numbers and it doesn't need you to input each number individually! The computer can also do things like: a) find out the amount of rain that fell in London, Manchester, and Edinburgh yesterday from an online weather service; b) work out the average rainfall for these three cities; and then c) work out the standard deviation. All in a matter of milliseconds! Or, it can do the same for 3,000 cities: it'll take a little bit longer, but it's the _same basic code_. \n",

They still have a hard time fooling anyone for very long. \n",

    "\n",
    "The difference is that games like Go and Chess have well-understood rules, as do processes like climate change and (sort of) earthquakes. We may not know all of the rules yet, and even simple games can produce trillions of possible 'next moves', but people don't have the same rules. Yes, conversations have norms (unless you're in an online comment forum you don't normally start a conversation by asking if someone is an idiot) but people don't just play 'games' according to those rules, they actually play with the rules themselves in a way that a computer finds very, very hard to follow.\n",

A computer can only do _exactly_ what you tell it to do, so if you don't know what to do then the computer won't either.\n",

That's what we mean about abstraction: it's not solving the problem _once_, it's solving any set of related problems as well. The rest of this course is really just about getting you started down that path.

    "### The 3 virtues of a programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful idea comes from [Larry Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall) (check out the 'tache!), who created a programming language called Perl. He said that programmers had three virtues: Laziness, Hubris, and Impatience. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://cdn.quotationof.com/images/larry-wall-1.jpg\",width=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that these are virtues in programming (but not in your university courses!) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Laziness makes you want to put in the effort _now_ to reduce the amount of effort you'll have to put in _later_. So the effort that went into inventing the calculator in the first place (and in making it easy to use) meant that lots and lots of other people never had to do this stuff by hand or using slide rules.\n",
    "2. Hubris makes you want to write code that other people won't want to \"say bad things about\". In the course we'll get into what makes 'good' code in more detail, but the short version is: it's efficient, it's easy to read, and it's clever.\n",
    "3. Impatience is about wanting the answer _now_ rather than waiting for a lazy computer. If you find yourself waiting long periods of time for something that the computer should be able to do _quickly_ then you should be impatient. Chances are, you made a mistake in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Hint: you'll also see a lot of laziness when you start trying to write code. Programmers don't like writing `remove` when they could just write `rm`, nor do they like writing `define` when they could just write `def`. Keep an eye out for these mnemonics as they can be pretty daunting at first._**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 3 false virtues\n",
    "\n",
    "Larry also pointed out that these virtues had three mirror-image false virtues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. False laziness happens when you leave something working but half-finished and, most likely, about to break. When you start using [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) you may find that it makes it easy to copy+paste answers into your homework and then you can glue it all together messily. This isn't the same as _understanding_ and _adapting_ the solution that you found online to _your_ problem, so it's false laziness.\n",
    "2. False hubris is thinking that no one else's code is 'good enough' for you. Sometimes copy+paste is false laziness, but refusing to recognise when copy+paste _is_ the right thing to do is false hubris.\n",
    "3. False impatience is getting started on solving a problem when you don't yet understand what the problem _is_. One thing that a lot of programmers do is half-listen to what someone has asked them to do and then go haring off without sitting down to make any kind of plan or structure. It's like writing an essay without having done the readings.\n",

    "## The Benefits of Coding?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a research context we think that the benefits of learning to code fall into three categories:\n",
    "1. Flexibility -- the computer can often apply the same analytical process to completely different data sets (_e.g._ rainfall in UK vs rainfall in the US) with minimal effort compared to trying to do each step in, say, Excel or SPSS. For students it comes down to this: let's say you discover a newer, better data set for your dissertation and want to use this for your analysis instead of the old, inaccurate data, it's a lot easier and faster to do this with code!\n",
    "2. Reproducibility -- recently, it's been discovered that a lot of research cannot be reproduced; in other words, if one scientist tries to duplicate what someone else did in order to check something out they're finding that the results don't line up. For stuents the benefit is this: you've just finished your analysis when someone points out that you made a mistake with the data right back at the beginning; redoing all of that in Excel or SPSS would be a nightmare, but with code it can be as easy as changing one line and hitting 'Run'!\n",
    "3. Scalability -- a computer doesn't care if you throw 10 lines or 10 billion lines at it, the only thing that changes is how long it takes to get an answer. In other words, if your code 'works' on a proper subset of your data it will also work on your entire data set no matter how big it is."
