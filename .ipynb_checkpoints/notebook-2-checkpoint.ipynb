    "\n",
    "Welcome back!\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've seen in the first two notebooks ('0' was the set-up notebook), in order to run Python programs (*scripts*) you can use the *Python Interpreter*. The interpreter is what reads your code and converts that into the binary instructions that the computer can understand – think of it as translator between you and the low-level components (operating system, file system, network, display, etc.) of your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first _proper_ programming lesson we are going to use Python interpreter to perform simple operations, like numeric calculations that you would normally do on a calculator and slightly more advanced operations on words.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progress trough the excercises we'll encounter a range of new programming concepts. At this stage don't worry too much about memorizing all of them, they will eventually come naturally. Try to develop a _sense_ of what is going on and keep the concepts in mind when reading the examples... but the really important thing is to try to apply them while _doing the excercises_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the exercises work\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, a few words on the excercises; in every notebook we've tried to develope a mix of exercises and examples to show you how Python works. There are four 'levels' of example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code from Scratch**: using examples already encountered in the lesson as a starting point, you will write some _very simple_ code (1-3 lines at most) into a blank code block. \n",
    "2. **Supported Code**: using examples and exercises already encountered in the lesson, you will fill in somes 'gaps' in the line lines of code where we've replaced some critical bits with (*???*) in order to make it work successfully.\n",
    "3. **Broken Code**: here we have deliberately broken something (sometimes, more than one thing) in the code and you will need to fix these before it will run successfully. Being able to _debug_ code is an integral part of being a programmer, and this will also require you to have an eye for detail because tiny typos and simple sloppiness are enough to break a computer program.\n",
    "4. **Applied Geo-Example**: this will be a much more advanced bit of code that will (we hope) run successfully right from the start. The point of these examples is to demonstrate a real-world _application_ of a concept covered in the lesson and we are asking you to spend some time puzzling over the code and adding comments about what you think is going on. Being able to read someone else's code and to make sense of what is going on is another crucial skill for a programmer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're not expecting you to master the fourth level at this stage; in fact, some of the examples might be challenging even after a full year of classes. However, we think it's important to try to show you where we're trying to go as well as the steps involved in how we get there. It's like trying to follow directions from someone who only tells you 'turn left', 'turn right', 'go straigh' – it's a lot easier to fill in the gaps and to understand what's going on if they say \"We're headed to London!\""

    "\n",
    "So far, everything we've done was about performing some kind of calculation on an integer, float, or string, and then showing the result. Given that a lot of programming doesn't involve solving everything in one easy line, how do you save an answer so that you can re-use it later? Let's start with the first true programming concept: the   **variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have studied other programming languages before then the concept of the variable will be so familiar to you that it's hard to remember even having to learn it! Some people think of a [variable as \"a box\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0aBwgLRNXI) that contains _values_ that we want to store and retrieve in the future. However, we think it might be more useful to think of a variable as the _handle_ of the box: for programmers, the handle is how we remember what we put in the box and where we put it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me try to explain: if you watched the introductory videos in the previous notebook, then you'll remember that the computer stores 'information' in lots of places (in memory, on the hard drive, etc.), but it doesn't use an addressing system that you or I would be able to read. Instead, it will use a long, complicated number that tells the computer \"Go look in this place for what to do when the mouse is clicked\" or \"Go look what to do when someone asks you to add together 1 and 5\". In the same way that Python translates between what we humans can deal with and what the computer can deal with, it also translates between the 'handles' that we use to refer to different boxes storing different things and how the computer finds what we _actually_ put there.\n",
