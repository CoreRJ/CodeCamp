    "[Slack](http://www.slack.com/) is a “messaging app for teams” that is designed to reduced email, organise conversations & topics of discussion, and pull in relevant data from a host of other services in a flexible, fully-searchable way. All in real-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want you to use Slack for four reasons:\n",
    "1. KEATS is clunky and formal -- it works well for one-to-many communication, but not so much for ‘chat’.\n",
    "2. Slack offers a searchable history -- you will have access to this archive for the next 2 years and beyond.\n",
    "3. You (and we) can access Slack on every major platform and Operating System (OSX, Windows, iOS, Android, and Windows Phone) and via a browser quickly.\n",
    "4. Slack is used in the ‘real world’ by everyone from Apple to PayPal and the JPL. This is how developers work.\n",
    "Last year, many students wanted to Direct Message (DM) us, which meant that others couldn't benefit from our answers and we ended up answering the same question multiple times. This year, we will only answer coding questions that have been asked publicly in the appropriate channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's be clear: learning to code is hard. We expect _all_ of you to end up needing help at some point and we will _not_ be marking down anyone who asks for help in a public channel. The best way to learn is as a _community_ -- this is a very different model of learning from the 'usual' one in a lecture class or seminar, and we want you to get the maximum benefit from it!"
