A key difference between [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) and [lists](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#lists) is that while elements in lists are ordered, dicts are unordered. This means that whereas for lists we use integers as indexes to access elements, in dictonaries we use 'keys' (which can multiple different types; strings, integers, etc.). Consequently, an important concept for dicts is that of key-value pairs. "
