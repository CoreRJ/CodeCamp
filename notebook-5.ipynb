    "### Lesson Content \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fifth Code Camp notebook! In this lesson we're going to explore two, more advanced *data types*. In previous weeks we looked at numeric (*integers* and *floats*) and textual (*strings*) data, but it's probably been quite difficult to imagine how you'd assemble these simple data into something useful. The new data types (lists and dictionaries) will _begin_ to show you how that can happen, and they will allow you to 'express' much more complex concepts with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, our variables have only held _one_ thing: a number, or a sequence of characters in a string. In other words, `myNumber = 5` or `myString = \"Hello world!\"`. With lists and dictionaries we can store _multiple_ things – much as you would with a _real_ dictionary (which holds the definitions of lots of words) or a _real_ list (which stores, for instance, the things that you need to get done today).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the simple explanations in parentheses above encompass the main difference between lists and dictionaries:\n",
    "- A _list_ is simply an *ordered* collection of 'items' (numbers, strings, etc.). You can ask for the first item in a list, the 3rd, or the 1,000th, it doesn't really matter because your list has an order and it keeps that order.\n",
    "- A _dictionary_ is an *unordered* collection of 'items' (numbers, strings, etc.). You access items in a dictionary in a similar way to how you access a real dictionary: you have a 'key' (i.e. the word for which you want the definition) and you use this to look up the 'value' (i.e. the definition of the word).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's obviously a lot more to lists and dictionaries than this, but it's a good starting point: lists = ordered, dictionaries = unordered.\n",

    "So a *list* is an ordered collection of items that we access by using a position. So the first items in a list is always the first item in the list, unless we change it in some way. Because lists are a different data-type, we create and use them differently from the simple variables we've seen before. You can always spot a list because it a series of items separated by commas and grouped together between a pair of square brackets ( *[...]* ).\n",

As a result, there is now a day in her honour every year that is celebrated at Google, Facebook, as well as places like King's and MIT because we want to recognise the fundamental contribution to computing made by women programmers who were long overlooked by the men.\n",

What did I mean just now by 'modifying the list directly'? Notice that in the first example above we had to write `myList = myList + ['New item']` because we had to write the result of concatening two lists together back to a variable, but in the second example we could just write `myList.append('New item')` and the change was made to `myList` directly! \n",

We're at risk of joining Alice down the rabbit-hole here, so let's just leave it at: the second set of functions are known as *methods* of the list *class*. We'll stop there. \n",
