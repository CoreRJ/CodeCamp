    "### Lesson Content \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fifth Code Camp notebook! In this lesson we're going to explore two, more advanced *data types*. In previous weeks we looked at numeric (*integers* and *floats*) and textual (*strings*) data, but it's probably been quite difficult to imagine how you'd assemble these simple data into something useful. The new data types (lists and dictionaries) will _begin_ to show you how that can happen, and they will allow you to 'express' much more complex concepts with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, our variables have only held _one_ thing: a number, or a string. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we've got: `myNumber = 5` or `myString = \"Hello world!\"`. And that's it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with **lists** and **dictionaries** we can store _multiple_ things: several numbers, several strings, or some mish-mash of both. This is much as you would with a _real_ dictionary (which holds the definitions of lots of words) or a _real_ list (which holds the things that you need to get done today).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the simple explanations in parentheses above encompass the main difference between lists and dictionaries:\n",
    "- A _list_ is an *ordered* collection of 'items' (numbers, strings, etc.). You can ask for the first item in a list, the 3rd, or the 1,000th, it doesn't really matter because your list has an order and it keeps that order.\n",
    "- A _dictionary_ is an *unordered* collection of 'items' (numbers, strings, etc.). You access items in a dictionary in a similar way to how you access a real dictionary: you have a 'key' (i.e. the word for which you want the definition) and you use this to look up the 'value' (i.e. the definition of the word).\n",
    "\n",
    "There's obviously a lot more to lists and dictionaries than this, but it's a good starting point: lists = ordered, dictionaries = unordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with *lists* in this notebook and we'll continue with *dictionaries* in the following.\n",

    "So a *list* is an ordered collection of items that we access by position (what Python calls the _index_). So the first item in a list is always the first item in the list. End of (well, sort of... more on this later). Because lists are a new data type, we create and use them differently from the simple variables we've seen so far. You can always spot a list because it is a series of items separated by commas and grouped together between a pair of square brackets ( *[A, B, C, ..., n]* ).\n",

    "_Note_: Actually, Lady Ada Lovelace is a [fascinating person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace): she isn't just the first female programmer, she was the first programmer full-stop. For many years Charles Babbage got all the credit simply because he was a guy, but lately we realised that Ada was the person who actually saw that Babbage hadn't just invented a better abacus, he'd invented a general purpose computing device! She was so far ahead of her time that the programme she invented in her head couldn't even run on Babbage's 'simple' (i.e. remarkably complex for the time) computer, but it is not recognised as the first computer algorithm. As a result, there is now a day in her honour every year that is celebrated around the world at places like Google and Facebook, as well as at King's and MIT, because we want to recognise the fundamental contribution to computing made by women programmers. They were long overlooked by the men who thought that the hard part was the machine, not the programming (which they erroneously thought was just like typing).\n",
